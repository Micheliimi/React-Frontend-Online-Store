## What was developed

This project is a simplified version, without database persistence, of an **online store**, developing its functionalities in a group according to the demands defined in a _Kanban_ board, in a scenario closer to the job market. From these demands, we have an application where users will be able to:
  - Search for products by terms and categories from the _Mercado Livre API_;
  - Interact with the searched products in order to add and remove them from a shopping cart in different quantities;
  - View details and previous reviews of a product, as well as create new reviews;
  - And finally, finalize the (simulated) purchase of the selected items.
